## Post Install

Azure Firewall WVD Policy is a sample as is and should be tested first. Additional rules to use AD Domain Services or Azure AD Domain Services and potentially other rules for Microsoft 365 services, Azure NetApp Files and others that may be appliacable for your WVD Host Pool may need to be added before adopting in production.
