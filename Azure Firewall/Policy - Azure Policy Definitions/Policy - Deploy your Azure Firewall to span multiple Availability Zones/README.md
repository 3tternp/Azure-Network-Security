## Deploy your Azure Firewall to span multiple Availability Zones

Azure has identified that some of your firewalls aren't deployed in multiple zones. Azure Firewall can be configured during deployment to span multiple Availability Zones for increased availability. With Availability Zones, your availability increases to 99.99% uptime. For more information, see the Azure Firewall Service Level Agreement (SLA). The 99.99% uptime SLA is offered when two or more Availability Zones are selected.
