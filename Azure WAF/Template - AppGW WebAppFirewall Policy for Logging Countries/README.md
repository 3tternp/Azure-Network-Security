# AppGW Web App Firewall Policy Sample
Author: [Nathan Swift](https://github.com/swiftsolves-msft)  


This Web App Firewall policy can be deployed and used with Application Gateway to block geolocations in a sanctioned or embargoed list. In addition,  a second rule captures and records the countries of the client IP requests to WAF by using a Log Only across all countries in a higher priority.
